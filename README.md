<h1 align="center"> Hi!  My name is Sergio Mora :space_invader: </h1>

<h3 align="center"> Recently i got my degree in Electronic Engineer so i thought this would be a great way to write about me, some projects i made while i was a student :nerd_face: and other stuff related with electronics. :computer: </h3>

<h4 align="center"> I like videogames :joystick:, cars :red_car: and PC stuff :desktop_computer: </h4>


I'am a 25 years old guy that just got his degree in Electronics Engineer. I really like cars a my dream car is a 350z, i hope one day i can get one in great conditions. I know is kinda cheap and easy to get one right know, so lets hope when i could afford it its price stays the same as today. Obviously i'm talking about outside Colombia, because this is Latam so... :pray:.

I like video games and i play a lot when i can. My first console was a PS2 and remember the first games i played were NFS Underground, Gran Turismo 4 and Burnout Revenge. Because those games, i like cars and have the music taste i have (Burnout Revenge's soundtrack is :ok_hand: :ok_hand:). After that console i got a PSP and a PS3. Those consoles gave me great memories playing when i was younger. 11 years ago on 2012 my dad bought me a laptop with a 3rd gen i7 and a GT650m , would you belive me if i told you that i still have that laptop as my daily? of course the only remains of it are the motherboard and the charger, because laptops don't survive well through pass of time. It works pretty fine, better than when it was brand new because it does not have all the case and stuff arround the board, so the thermals are way better (and because a custome fan i put next to it for cooling). Yeah, i can not play the newest games on it, it turns out on a 1 fps bread toaster when i try it :fire::upside_down_face:.

<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Francisco Calderon</h1>

<h3 align="center">Full time professor at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana. </h3>

<h4 align="center">I love birds, photography, astronomy, 3d printing, and hiking.</h4>

My area of expertise is the digital processing of multidimensional signals such as images and video. I have experience implementing microcontrolled systems for signal processing. As well as complex embedded systems that require the use of low and high level operating systems.

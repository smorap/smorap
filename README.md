<h1 align="center"> Hi!  My name is Sergio Mora :space_invader: </h1>

<h3 align="center"> Recently i got my degree in Electronic Engineer so i thought this would be a great way to write about me, some projects i made while i was a student :nerd_face: and other stuff related with electronics. :computer: </h3>

<h4 align="center"> I like videogames :joystick:, cars :red_car: and PC stuff :desktop_computer: </h4>


I'am a 25 years old guy that just got his degree in Electronics Engineer. I really like cars a my dream car is a 350z, i hope one day i can get one in great conditions. I know it is kinda cheap and easy to get one right know, so lets hope when i could afford its price stays the same as today. Obviously i'm talking about outside Colombia, because this is Latam so... :pray:.
